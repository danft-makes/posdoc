# example2.sage
	* Dependencies: utils.sage, generate_generic_lines_ex2.sage -> generic_lines_ex2.txt
	* Outputs: example2.log
	* Objective: Computes the minimal derivation d in Der(f), then for each l in Lines it computes V("ld") (two points) and then uses other two distinguished points in V(l) to give its cross-ratio.
	* Conclusion: Cross-Ratio = -1 => The two points in V("ld") are "harmonic conjugates" to the two distinguished points.
